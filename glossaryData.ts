  { term: "Actor", definition: "An actor is a role label for any entity that can take actions in a blockchain system. It is the underlying agent, such as a person, organization, node, smart contract, or device, that can originate, validate, or relay transactions and messages. Unlike an address, which is just a cryptographic identifier, an actor is the real-world or logical entity that may control many addresses or nodes.", letter: "A" },
  { term: "Address", definition: "An address is a cryptographic identifier used as a destination or source for payments and messages on a blockchain. It encodes information derived from a public key so that funds can be assigned and later unlocked by the corresponding private key. Unlike a private key, which must remain secret, an address is meant to be shared and is often treated as disposable, with best practice in bitcoin being to use a fresh address for each transaction.", letter: "A" },
  { term: "Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)", definition: "An ASIC is a class of hardware chip designed to perform one specific computation pattern extremely efficiently. In blockchain systems it is typically wired to run a single hash function, such as SHA256, at very high throughput for mining. Unlike a general CPU or GPU, which can run many different programs, an ASIC trades versatility for vastly higher performance and energy efficiency on its target workload.", letter: "A" },
  { term: "Bitcoin", definition: "Bitcoin is a global peer-to-peer electronic cash system and ledger protocol that uses proof-of-work and a UTXO-based transaction model to record ownership and transfer of value. At the conceptual level, \u201cBitcoin\u201d refers to the network, rules, and data structure, while \u201cbitcoin\u201d refers to the native currency unit whose smallest division is the satoshi. Unlike account-based chains like Ethereum, bitcoin tracks spendable outputs rather than balances tied to a single long-lived account.", letter: "B" },
  { term: "Block", definition: "A block is a structured record that groups a set of validated transactions and associated metadata into a single unit for addition to a blockchain. It typically contains a header (including references to the previous block and a Merkle root of transactions) plus a list of transactions that update the chain\u2019s state. Unlike an individual transaction, which changes state locally, a block anchors those transactions into the global history and is referenced by later blocks.", letter: "B" },
  { term: "Block, Canonical", definition: "A canonical block is a block that lies on the chain\u2019s selected \u201cbest\u201d history, directly or indirectly referenced by subsequent blocks in the active longest or most-work chain. It defines the authoritative state at its height for nodes following the consensus rules. Unlike orphaned or stale blocks, which may be valid but discarded during reorganization, a canonical block remains part of the accepted ledger history.", letter: "B" },
  { term: "Block, Genesis", definition: "A genesis block is the first block of a blockchain, with height zero, from which all later blocks derive their linkage. It sets initial parameters such as network configuration, initial allocations, and protocol constants. Unlike later blocks, the genesis block has no previous-block reference and is normally hard-coded into node software.", letter: "B" },
  { term: "Blockchain", definition: "A blockchain is a data structure and protocol that stores records as an ordered sequence of blocks, each cryptographically linked to its predecessor by hash. It enforces rules about what constitutes a valid transaction and block, and nodes reject blocks that violate these rules. Unlike a generic append-only log, a blockchain is designed to operate in a decentralized environment where consensus among independent nodes is required.", letter: "B" },
  { term: "Block Depth", definition: "Block depth is a relative measure of how far a block is from the tip of the chain in terms of subsequent blocks built on top of it. It reflects how many confirmations or successors separate that block from the most recent block. Unlike block height, which is absolute from the genesis, depth is measured backward from the current head and changes as new blocks are added.", letter: "B" },
  { term: "Block Explorer", definition: "A block explorer is an application, typically with a web or GUI front end, that indexes blockchain data and makes it searchable and human-readable. It allows users and tools to query transactions, blocks, addresses, and statistics without running a full node or manual decoding. Unlike a node, which enforces consensus rules, a block explorer is a convenience layer for inspection and analytics.", letter: "B" },
  { term: "Block Height", definition: "Block height is the count of blocks from the genesis to a given block, representing its absolute position in the chain. The genesis block has a height of zero, and each valid successor increments the height by one. Unlike block depth, which is relative to the tip, height is a stable identifier for a block\u2019s position in a given branch.", letter: "B" },
  { term: "Block Reward", definition: "A block reward is the native-asset payment a protocol grants to the miner or validator that successfully produces a new block, often combining newly issued coins and transaction fees. It is the economic mechanism that funds security and incentivizes participation in block production. Unlike transaction fees, which come from users, the subsidy portion of the block reward comes from inflation defined by the protocol schedule.", letter: "B" },
  { term: "BANKING SECRECY ACT (BSA)", definition: "The BSA is a United States federal statute that regulates financial institutions\u2019 recordkeeping and reporting obligations to combat money laundering and related crimes. It mandates monitoring, customer identification, and suspicious activity reporting for covered entities. Unlike technical blockchain rules, the BSA is a legal framework that applies off-chain but shapes how custodians and exchanges may operate.", letter: "B" },
  { term: "BYZANTINE FAULT TOLERANCE", definition: "Byzantine fault tolerance is a property of a distributed system that allows correct consensus even when some participants behave arbitrarily or maliciously. It guarantees that honest nodes can agree on a single state as long as the proportion of faulty nodes stays below a specific threshold, often one-third. Unlike simple crash fault tolerance, which only handles node failures, BFT explicitly models adversarial behavior and inconsistent messaging.", letter: "B" },
  { term: "CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY (CA)", definition: "A CA is an entity in a public-key infrastructure that issues and signs digital certificates binding public keys to identities. It acts as a centralized trust root for verifying that a domain or subject controls a particular key pair. Unlike blockchain-style trustless verification, a CA operates on a trust-institution model where users rely on the CA\u2019s integrity and processes.", letter: "C" },
  { term: "Closed Source", definition: "Closed source describes software whose human-readable source code is not publicly distributed and can only be inspected or modified by its owner or licensees. Users interact with compiled binaries without visibility into internal logic. Unlike open source, closed source designs cannot be independently audited or forked by the broader community.", letter: "C" },
  { term: "Coin", definition: "A coin is a native on-chain asset that is directly issued and accounted for by the base protocol of a blockchain. It typically serves as the primary medium of exchange, fee unit, and staking or mining incentive. Unlike many application-level tokens, coins are integral to consensus and are not implemented purely as smart contracts on top of another chain.", letter: "C" },
  { term: "Coinbase (Company)", definition: "Coinbase is a centralized, regulated cryptocurrency brokerage and exchange platform based in the United States. It provides fiat on- and off-ramps, custody, and trading services for a curated set of digital assets. Unlike decentralized exchanges, Coinbase holds user assets and order books under its own control and operates under traditional financial compliance regimes.", letter: "C" },
  { term: "Coinbase (Mining)", definition: "In mining terminology, the coinbase is the special transaction within a block that pays the block reward to a designated address. It has no normal inputs and effectively mints the newly authorized coins plus aggregates transaction fees. Unlike ordinary transactions, the coinbase transaction is protocol-created and can only appear once per block.", letter: "C" },
  { term: "Command-Line Interface (CLI)", definition: "A CLI is a text-based interaction mode where users issue commands and read responses in a terminal or console. It exposes program functions directly, often with more control and options than graphical tools. Unlike a GUI, a CLI requires familiarity with commands but is favored by developers and automation scripts for precision and scripting.", letter: "C" },
  { term: "CONFIRMATION", definition: "A confirmation is a measure of how many blocks have been built on top of the block containing a given transaction, indicating its embeddedness in the chain history. Each added block exponentially reduces the chance that a competing branch will reorganize it away under normal assumptions. Unlike mere broadcast or mempool presence, confirmed transactions are those anchored in blocks with sufficient depth to be considered practically immutable.", letter: "C" },
  { term: "Consensus", definition: "Consensus is the process by which distributed nodes in a blockchain system agree on a single sequence of blocks and the resulting state. It combines rules about block validity with a selection mechanism (such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake) to pick one branch as canonical when forks occur. Unlike simple voting, blockchain consensus must tolerate network delays and adversarial participants while still converging on one history.", letter: "C" },
  { term: "Consortium", definition: "A consortium chain is a permissioned blockchain operated collaboratively by a defined set of organizations rather than the open public. It provides shared, append-only records between known parties while restricting access and write privileges. Unlike fully public chains, consortium blockchains prioritize governance and confidentiality within a controlled membership.", letter: "C" },
  { term: "Cryptocurrency", definition: "A cryptocurrency is a common name given to a digitally native asset whose ownership and transfer are secured by cryptographic mechanisms on a distributed ledger. It uses public-key signatures and consensus rules to prevent double-spending without relying on a central issuer. Unlike fiat currency, which rests on legal decree and banking infrastructure, cryptocurrency derives its integrity from protocol-enforced computation and economic incentives.", letter: "C" },
  { term: "Cryptography", definition: "Cryptography is a branch of applied mathematics and computer science that designs algorithms for confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of data. It underpins digital signatures, hashing, and encryption used across blockchains for securing transactions and keys. Unlike general data structures, cryptographic primitives are defined by rigorous hardness assumptions and security proofs.", letter: "C" },
  { term: "Currency", definition: "Currency is a system of standardized units used to denominate and settle debts and prices within an economy. It serves as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. Unlike a single blockchain token, which may have niche scope, a national currency like the US dollar is backed by legal frameworks and central banking policy.", letter: "C" },
  { term: "DApp", definition: "A DApp is an application whose core logic runs on a blockchain or similar decentralized network rather than a single server. It uses smart contracts for state and rules, while clients interact via wallets and node interfaces. Unlike traditional web apps that rely on centralized backend databases, DApps derive correctness and persistence from consensus among independent nodes.", letter: "D" },
  { term: "Decentralization", definition: "Decentralization is a structural property where control, decision-making, and data storage are distributed across many independent actors instead of a single authority. In blockchain contexts it means no one party can unilaterally change rules or censor valid transactions. Unlike federated or centralized systems, a properly decentralized network continues to operate even if individual actors fail or misbehave.", letter: "D" },
  { term: "Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)", definition: "A DAO is an organization whose governance rules and asset controls are encoded in smart contracts rather than traditional legal agreements. Members interact by submitting on-chain proposals and votes, and outcomes are enforced automatically by code. Unlike a conventional company, a DAO\u2019s authority structure is transparent in its contract logic and does not rely solely on a board or management team.", letter: "D" },
  { term: "Decentralized Finance (DeFi)", definition: "DeFi is a category of financial protocols built on blockchains that implement lending, trading, derivatives, and asset management through smart contracts. Users interact directly with contract code, often providing collateral or liquidity to algorithmic markets. Unlike traditional finance, DeFi services can be non-custodial, composable, and globally accessible without conventional intermediaries.", letter: "D" },
  { term: "Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)", definition: "A DAG is a graph structure composed of vertices and directed edges with no cycles, so traversal never returns to a prior node. In blockchain-adjacent systems it is used to model dependencies between transactions, blocks, or data chunks without requiring a single linear chain. Unlike a traditional blockchain, a DAG-based ledger can allow multiple branches to grow concurrently while still enforcing partial ordering.", letter: "D" },
  { term: "Double Spend Attack", definition: "A double spend attack is a deliberate attempt by a malicious actor to create two conflicting transactions spending the same coins and convince different counterparties to accept each as valid. The attacker relies on network latency or chain reorganization to have only their preferred transaction end up in the canonical chain. Unlike the general concept of a double spend, which is any conflicting use of the same UTXO, a double spend attack emphasizes the adversarial misuse to defraud others.", letter: "D" },
  { term: "Ether (ETH)", definition: "Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, used to pay gas for transactions and smart contract execution. It is an account-based asset, with balances tracked directly in the global state. Unlike bitcoin\u2019s UTXO model, Ether exists as aggregate balances on addresses and contracts rather than discrete spendable outputs.", letter: "E" },
  { term: "Ethereum", definition: "Ethereum is a programmable blockchain that extends the basic transaction model with a general-purpose virtual machine and smart contracts. It supports arbitrary stateful logic through its EVM and has become a primary platform for DeFi, NFTs, and other on-chain applications. Unlike bitcoin, which is optimized for simple, scalable payments, Ethereum\u2019s core design targets rich application logic at the base layer.", letter: "E" },
  { term: "Etherscan", definition: "Etherscan is a web-based block explorer and analytics platform specifically for Ethereum and related networks. It provides indexed views of accounts, contracts, transactions, logs, and gas markets. Unlike a generic node, Etherscan adds labeling, search, and decoding features that make Ethereum\u2019s raw data intelligible to developers and users.", letter: "E" },
  { term: "Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA)", definition: "The EEA is an industry consortium of companies and institutions collaborating to promote and standardize enterprise uses of Ethereum technology. It coordinates working groups, reference architectures, and shared requirements for business-oriented deployments. Unlike public Ethereum governance, which is open and community-driven, the EEA focuses on enterprise adoption and interoperability across corporate stakeholders.", letter: "E" },
  { term: "Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)", definition: "The EVM is Ethereum\u2019s deterministic execution environment that processes smart contract bytecode and state transitions. It defines the instruction set, gas costs, and semantics that every node must implement identically for consensus. Unlike a general OS virtual machine, the EVM is purpose-built for blockchain determinism, gas metering, and replayable state updates.", letter: "E" },
  { term: "eWASM", definition: "eWASM is an Ethereum-oriented adaptation of WebAssembly designed as a next-generation execution target for smart contracts. It enables contracts written in multiple languages to compile to a standardized binary format with performance and safety benefits. Unlike the legacy EVM bytecode, eWASM aims to leverage broader WASM tooling and closer-to-native execution.", letter: "E" },
  { term: "Exchange", definition: "An exchange is a service that facilitates trading between different cryptocurrencies and often between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. It maintains order books, matches trades, and typically holds custody of user deposits. Unlike decentralized exchanges, centralized exchanges operate under corporate control and regulatory oversight.", letter: "E" },
  { term: "Exchange, Decentralized", definition: "A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a smart-contract-based trading system where users swap assets directly from their own wallets. Liquidity is usually provided by users through pools or on-chain order books rather than a centralized intermediary. Unlike centralized exchanges, DEXs do not require users to deposit funds into custodial accounts.", letter: "E" },
  { term: "Fiat", definition: "Fiat is government-issued currency declared legal tender and not backed by a physical commodity. Its supply and value are managed through monetary policy rather than a fixed algorithm. Unlike cryptocurrency, fiat relies on legal systems and central banks rather than cryptographic consensus for validation and issuance.", letter: "F" },
  { term: "Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)", definition: "FinCEN is a bureau of the U.S. Treasury responsible for enforcing laws related to money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. It issues regulations and guidance that affect money services businesses, including many crypto exchanges and custodians. Unlike technical blockchain standards, FinCEN\u2019s authority derives from statutory law and applies through compliance obligations.", letter: "F" },
  { term: "Fork", definition: "A fork is a divergence in a blockchain\u2019s history or rules where two or more branches share some common ancestry but then follow different block sequences or protocol versions. Forks can occur naturally from competing blocks or be driven by explicit software upgrades or governance decisions. Unlike a mere temporary chain split, a persistent fork can result in distinct networks and assets if not reconciled.", letter: "F" },
  { term: "Fork, Hard", definition: "A hard fork is a protocol change that introduces new rules incompatible with old nodes, such that blocks valid under the new rules may be rejected by software that has not upgraded. This can permanently split the network into separate chains if consensus on the change is not unanimous. Unlike a soft fork, which tightens rules while preserving backward compatibility, a hard fork expands or alters the rule set in non-compatible ways.", letter: "F" },
  { term: "FORK, SOFT", definition: "A soft fork is a protocol change that tightens validation rules so that new blocks are still valid to upgraded nodes and also appear valid to old nodes, as long as miners enforce the new constraints. It relies on majority behavior coordination to enforce the stricter interpretation. This coordination is sometimes labeled malicious if the tightened rules change network behavior in a way that subverts nodes running legacy software. Unlike a hard fork, a soft fork does not necessarily create a lasting chain split if older software continues accepting the stricter blocks.", letter: "F" },
  { term: "Gas", definition: "Gas is an abstract metering unit that measures the computational and storage effort required to execute operations in a smart contract environment. Each opcode or action consumes a fixed or defined amount of gas, which users pay for in the chain\u2019s native token. Unlike transaction size in bytes, gas quantifies logical complexity, preventing infinite loops and resource abuse.", letter: "G" },
  { term: "Gas Price", definition: "Gas price is the amount of native token a user is willing to pay per unit of gas consumed by their transaction. It determines priority in block inclusion when miners or validators select among competing transactions. Unlike gas itself, which measures resource usage, gas price expresses the user\u2019s bid in economic terms.", letter: "G" },
  { term: "Gossip Protocol", definition: "A gossip protocol is a message dissemination method where each node forwards new information to a subset or all of its peers until it propagates through the network. It achieves eventual consistency without a central broadcaster. Unlike direct client-server broadcasting, gossip scales organically as each participant helps spread data.", letter: "G" },
  { term: "Graphical User Interface (GUI)", definition: "A GUI is a visual interface that represents program functions with windows, icons, menus, and other graphical elements. It abstracts low-level commands into clickable or touchable interactions for usability. Unlike a CLI, which relies solely on text, a GUI targets ease of use for non-technical users.", letter: "G" },
  { term: "Hash", definition: "A hash is the fixed-size output of a hash function applied to arbitrary input data. It acts as a compact fingerprint that changes drastically with any alteration to the input. Unlike encryption, hashing is one-way and does not allow recovery of the original message from the hash alone.", letter: "H" },
  { term: "Hash Collision", definition: "A hash collision occurs when two distinct inputs produce the same hash output. It represents a failure of ideal uniqueness for that hash function. Unlike the normal case where different inputs yield different hashes, collisions undermine certain security guarantees such as tamper-evidence and resistance to forgery.", letter: "H" },
  { term: "Hashgraph", definition: "Hashgraph is a particular type of distributed ledger structure that combines a gossip protocol with a DAG of events to reach consensus. It uses virtual voting based on message histories instead of traditional proof-of-work or proof-of-stake. Unlike a linear blockchain, hashgraph maintains a more complex event graph to optimize throughput and latency.", letter: "H" },
  { term: "Hashrate", definition: "Hashrate is the number of hash function evaluations a miner or network can perform per second. It quantifies raw proof-of-work capacity for a given algorithm. Unlike clock speed alone, hashrate directly measures performance on the specific mining function.", letter: "H" },
  { term: "Hash Function", definition: "A hash function is a deterministic algorithm that maps input data of arbitrary length to a fixed-length output in a way that is designed to be collision-resistant and preimage-resistant. It is used in blockchains to link blocks, build Merkle trees, and identify data succinctly. Unlike general compression, cryptographic hash functions are engineered to resist intentional manipulation.", letter: "H" },
  { term: "Hexadecimal Notation", definition: "Hexadecimal notation is a base-16 representation of numbers using digits 0\u20139 and letters A\u2013F. It provides a compact, human-readable format for binary data like hashes, keys, and addresses. Unlike decimal notation, hex aligns cleanly with byte and nibble boundaries in computer systems.", letter: "H" },
  { term: "Hyperledger", definition: "Hyperledger is a collection of open-source enterprise blockchain frameworks and tools hosted by the Linux Foundation. It provides modular components for building permissioned ledgers and consortium networks. Unlike public chains like bitcoin, Hyperledger projects target private, business-oriented deployments with configurable consensus and identity models.", letter: "H" },
  { term: "Initial Coin Offering (ICO)", definition: "An ICO is a fundraising mechanism where a project sells newly issued tokens to early backers in exchange for established cryptocurrencies or fiat. The tokens typically represent utility or speculative value in a future ecosystem. Unlike a traditional IPO, ICOs often occur before a working product and historically have operated in more ambiguous regulatory territory.", letter: "I" },
  { term: "Immutability", definition: "Immutability is the property of data that cannot be altered once written without detection or prohibitive cost. In blockchains this is approximated by chaining blocks with proof-of-work or similar, making rewrites economically or computationally unfeasible. Unlike ordinary database entries, which administrators can edit directly, immutable records require constructing an explicit, traceable new history.", letter: "I" },
  { term: "Java", definition: "Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language designed for portability across platforms via the Java Virtual Machine. It is widely used for server-side systems, enterprise applications, and Android development. Unlike JavaScript, which runs primarily in browsers, Java typically compiles to JVM bytecode and runs in a separate runtime.", letter: "J" },
  { term: "JavaScript", definition: "JavaScript is a dynamic, high-level programming language standardized as ECMAScript and originally designed for scripting in web browsers. It now runs on servers and tools via runtimes like Node.js and is commonly used to interact with blockchain nodes and wallets. Unlike Java, JavaScript is prototype-based and interpreted or JIT-compiled within host environments.", letter: "J" },
  { term: "Mainnet", definition: "Mainnet is the primary, production blockchain network for a given protocol where real economic value is at stake. It runs the canonical version of the software and consensus rules used by most participants. Unlike testnets, mainnets are not intended for experimentation and carry real financial risk.", letter: "M" },
  { term: "Merkle Proof", definition: "A Merkle proof is a minimal set of hashes that allows a verifier to confirm that a particular leaf belongs to a specific Merkle root. It reconstructs the path from the leaf to the root by iteratively hashing sibling nodes. Unlike downloading the entire tree, a Merkle proof provides membership verification with logarithmic-size data.", letter: "M" },
  { term: "Merkle Tree", definition: "A Merkle tree is a binary (or k-ary) tree structure where leaves contain hashes of data items and internal nodes store hashes of their children, culminating in a single root hash. It enables efficient integrity checks and membership proofs for large sets of data such as all transactions in a block. Unlike a flat list of hashes, a Merkle tree supports concise proofs and incremental verification.", letter: "M" },
  { term: "Merkle Root", definition: "A Merkle root is the top-level hash produced by aggregating all leaf hashes in a Merkle tree. It uniquely commits to the exact set and order of underlying data items under the chosen hash function. Unlike a single transaction hash, the Merkle root anchors an entire batch of data in one compact value.", letter: "M" },
  { term: "Metamask", definition: "Metamask is a browser-extension and mobile wallet that manages Ethereum-compatible keys and injects web3 APIs into web pages. It lets users sign transactions, interact with DApps, and manage accounts without running a full node. Unlike hardware wallets, Metamask stores keys in software within the user\u2019s browser or device.", letter: "M" },
  { term: "Miner", definition: "A miner is an actor that assembles candidate blocks and participates in proof-of-work or other consensus processes to add them to the chain. They validate transactions, solve consensus puzzles, and claim block rewards. Unlike ordinary nodes that only relay and verify, miners actively compete or are selected to extend the ledger.", letter: "M" },
  { term: "Miner, CPU", definition: "A CPU miner uses a general-purpose central processing unit to perform mining computations. It can run algorithms that require sequential or complex branching logic unsuited to massive parallelization. Unlike GPU or ASIC miners, CPU miners are usually much slower on simple hash puzzles but more flexible for compute-intensive algorithms.", letter: "M" },
  { term: "Miner, GPU", definition: "A GPU miner uses a graphics processing unit to perform large numbers of parallel hashing or arithmetic operations for mining. It excels at algorithms that can be broken into many identical, independent tasks. Unlike ASIC miners, GPUs remain programmable for multiple algorithms, but they are less efficient on any single specialized function.", letter: "M" },
  { term: "Miner, ASIC", definition: "An ASIC miner uses custom-designed chips dedicated to a specific mining algorithm, such as SHA256 for bitcoin. It delivers the highest hashrate per watt and per dollar on that algorithm. Unlike GPU miners, ASIC miners are tied to a narrow function and become obsolete if the algorithm or economics change significantly.", letter: "M" },
  { term: "Mining", definition: "Mining is the process of producing new blocks in a proof-of-work or similar consensus system by validating transactions and solving computational puzzles. It secures the network by making it costly to rewrite history while rewarding honest participants with block rewards and fees. Unlike simple transaction relaying, mining involves capital investment in hardware and energy to participate in block creation.", letter: "M" },
  { term: "Mining Pool", definition: "A mining pool is a coordinated group of miners who aggregate their hashpower and share block rewards proportionally to contributed work. It reduces income variance for individual miners while centralizing block template creation. Unlike solo mining, pooled mining means most blocks originate from a few large pool operators.", letter: "M" },
  { term: "Monero (XMR)", definition: "Monero is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that obscures transaction details using ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential amounts. It aims to make sender, recipient, and value hard to trace on-chain. Unlike bitcoin, which has transparent UTXOs by default, Monero\u2019s design makes meaningful chain analysis significantly harder.", letter: "M" },
  { term: "Money Transmitting", definition: "Money transmitting is the regulated activity of receiving funds from one party and transmitting them to another as an intermediary. In many jurisdictions it triggers licensing, reporting, and compliance obligations. Unlike direct peer-to-peer transfers, money transmission involves a third party temporarily controlling funds.", letter: "M" },
  { term: "Network", definition: "A network is a set of nodes and links through which messages and data propagate according to defined protocols. In blockchain contexts it refers to the collection of participating peers that share blocks, transactions, and state information. Unlike a single node, the network\u2019s emergent behavior defines consensus and availability.", letter: "N" },
  { term: "Node", definition: "A node is a software instance connected to a blockchain network that participates in propagating and validating data. It enforces protocol rules on received blocks and transactions and maintains a local view of the ledger. Unlike a wallet that may only sign and broadcast transactions, a node checks other participants\u2019 messages against consensus rules.", letter: "N" },
  { term: "Node, Full", definition: "A full node is a node that downloads and verifies all blocks and transactions according to the protocol from genesis onward. It can independently compute the current state without trusting external sources. Unlike light nodes, full nodes do not rely on simplified proofs from other peers for validation. Some definitions require a node to build blocks to be considered \"full nodes.\"", letter: "N" },
  { term: "Node, Light", definition: "A light node is a node that tracks only block headers and selected data, using SPV or similar methods to verify transactions without storing the full chain. It reduces storage and bandwidth requirements at the cost of relying more on other nodes\u2019 responses. Unlike full nodes, light nodes cannot fully rederive state on their own.", letter: "N" },
  { term: "Opcode", definition: "An opcode is a low-level instruction code that tells a virtual machine or processor which operation to perform. In bitcoin Script or the EVM, opcodes implement arithmetic, stack manipulation, flow control, and cryptographic checks. Unlike high-level language constructs, opcodes are executed directly by the interpreter with fixed semantics and gas or resource costs.", letter: "O" },
  { term: "Open Source", definition: "Open source refers to software whose source code is publicly available and licensed to allow inspection, modification, and redistribution. It enables community review, forkability, and collaborative development. Unlike closed source, open code can be audited for security and correctness by anyone.", letter: "O" },
  { term: "Oracle (Company)", definition: "Oracle is a commercial software vendor known for its database products and enterprise middleware, as well as for originating the Java language. It operates in traditional enterprise IT rather than blockchain infrastructure. Unlike blockchain \u201coracles,\u201d the company is not itself a cryptographic data-bridge service.", letter: "O" },
  { term: "Oracle (Service)", definition: "An oracle service is middleware that feeds external, off-chain data into on-chain smart contracts in a verifiable way. It bridges blockchains with real-world signals like prices, weather, or events that the chain cannot observe directly. Unlike pure on-chain computation, oracles introduce trusted or partially trusted data sources into the system.", letter: "O" },
  { term: "Peer-to-Peer (P2P)", definition: "P2P describes architectures where participants connect directly to one another without a central hub, exchanging data and services among equals. Bitcoin\u2019s network layer is P2P, with each node relaying transactions and blocks it learns about. Unlike client\u2013server models, P2P networks distribute both workload and authority across many peers.", letter: "P" },
  { term: "Private Key", definition: "A private key is a secret numerical value in a public-key cryptosystem that grants control over corresponding addresses and enables digital signatures. It is used to sign transactions so that the network can verify authorization without revealing the key itself. Unlike a public key or address, a private key must never be shared, as disclosure allows full control over associated funds.", letter: "P" },
  { term: "PRIVATE KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI)", definition: "A PKI is a framework of hardware, software, policies, and procedures that manages key pairs and certificates for identity and authentication. It coordinates issuance, revocation, and validation of bindings between keys and subjects. Unlike ad hoc key usage in many wallets, PKI formalizes trust chains through certificate authorities and standardized protocols.", letter: "P" },
  { term: "PROOF-OF-LIQUIDITY", definition: "Proof-of-liquidity is a mechanism where a trusted auditor or on-chain process attests that an issuer holds sufficient backing assets for a pegged token. It typically produces cryptographic or signed evidence tying reserves to circulating supply. Unlike proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, it secures claims about backing, not block production.", letter: "P" },
  { term: "Proof-of-Stake (PoS)", definition: "PoS is a class of consensus mechanisms where block production rights are allocated probabilistically based on the amount of native tokens staked by validators. Security rests on the economic cost of misbehavior via slashing or forfeiture of stake. Unlike proof-of-work, PoS relies on capital lockup rather than energy expenditure.", letter: "P" },
  { term: "Proof-of-Stake, Delegated (DPoS)", definition: "DPoS is a variant of PoS where token holders vote to elect a limited set of block producers who actually create blocks on behalf of the stakeholders. Voting weight typically scales with stake, and producer sets can change over time. Unlike pure PoS with many direct validators, DPoS concentrates block production into a smaller, elected group.", letter: "P" },
  { term: "Proof-of-Work (PoW)", definition: "PoW is a consensus mechanism where participants compete to solve computational puzzles whose difficulty can be tuned, and the winner earns the right to append the next block. It ties block creation to verifiable energy and hardware expenditure, making large-scale attacks costly. Unlike PoS, PoW security is anchored in external resource burn rather than locked capital.", letter: "P" },
  { term: "PROOF-OF-WORK, DELEGATED (DPOW)", definition: "DPoW extends PoW by allowing the entity that found a valid proof to delegate block-creation rights to another actor. The solver demonstrates computational work but may not be the final block author. Unlike standard PoW, DPoW separates the roles of puzzle-solving and block assembly.", letter: "P" },
  { term: "Public Key", definition: "A public key is the non-secret counterpart to a private key in asymmetric cryptography, mathematically linked so signatures can be verified. It can be shared widely to receive funds or encrypted messages. Unlike an address, which is often a hashed or encoded derivative, the public key itself is used directly in signature verification.", letter: "P" },
  { term: "Ring Signature", definition: "A ring signature is a type of digital signature that proves a signer belongs to a specific group of possible signers without revealing which member signed. Verification confirms that one key in the ring authorized the message, but not which one. Unlike a standard signature, which binds to a single known key, ring signatures provide signer ambiguity for privacy.", letter: "R" },
  { term: "Ripple", definition: "Ripple is a payment-focused blockchain and associated network designed to connect banks, payment providers, and exchanges for cross-border transfers. Its protocol uses a consensus mechanism distinct from PoW or PoS and centers on institutional gateways. Unlike retail-oriented cryptocurrencies, Ripple\u2019s emphasis is on interbank settlement and liquidity.", letter: "R" },
  { term: "Scalability", definition: "Scalability is the ability of a blockchain or protocol to maintain acceptable performance as transaction volume, users, or data size grow. It considers metrics like throughput, latency, storage, and bandwidth under load. Unlike raw correctness, scalability concerns how well a system handles real-world scale without degradation.", letter: "S" },
  { term: "Scatter", definition: "Scatter is a multi-chain wallet and identity manager that supports networks like Ethereum, EOS, and bitcoin. It handles key storage, transaction signing, and DApp integration. Unlike a single-chain wallet, Scatter aims to unify user identity and signing across several protocols.", letter: "S" },
  { term: "Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)", definition: "SHA refers to a family of cryptographic hash functions standardized by NIST and originally designed by the NSA. Each variant (such as SHA1, SHA256) specifies output size and internal structure. Unlike non-cryptographic hashes, SHAs are designed to resist collisions and preimage attacks.", letter: "S" },
  { term: "Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)", definition: "The SEC is a U.S. federal agency tasked with regulating securities markets and enforcing securities laws. It evaluates whether certain tokens qualify as securities and oversees compliant offerings and trading platforms. Unlike technical protocol bodies, the SEC shapes crypto markets through legal definitions and enforcement.", letter: "S" },
  { term: "Security Token Offering (STO)", definition: "An STO is a token sale in which the token is explicitly treated as a regulated security under applicable law. It typically restricts participation to accredited investors and uses compliant platforms for issuance and trading. Unlike an unregistered ICO, an STO operates within formal securities frameworks.", letter: "S" },
  { term: "SHA256", definition: "SHA256 is a specific SHA family member that produces a 256-bit hash output from arbitrary input. It is used in bitcoin for block hashing, transaction IDs, and parts of address generation. Unlike shorter hashes like SHA1, SHA256 offers stronger resistance to brute-force and collision attacks.", letter: "S" },
  { term: "Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT)", definition: "A SAFT is a contractual instrument where investors fund a project in exchange for a promise of future token allocation once the network is live. It models token sales after SAFE agreements used in equity financing but denominates claims in tokens instead of shares. Unlike direct token sales, SAFTs separate the fundraising phase from the token\u2019s eventual issuance.", letter: "S" },
  { term: "Solidity", definition: "Solidity is a high-level, contract-oriented programming language targeting the EVM. It resembles C++ and JavaScript syntactically and compiles down to EVM bytecode. Unlike Vyper, which emphasizes simplicity and formal verifiability, Solidity prioritizes flexibility and developer familiarity.", letter: "S" },
  { term: "Smart Contract", definition: "A smart contract is code deployed on a blockchain that maintains state and enforces rules autonomously when invoked by transactions. It executes deterministically on every validating node, ensuring consistent results. Unlike off-chain contracts, smart contracts are self-enforcing and transparent in their logic to anyone reading the chain.", letter: "S" },
  { term: "STATE MACHINE", definition: "A state machine is a computation model where a system occupies one of a finite set of states and transitions between states via defined inputs and rules. Blockchains can be viewed as replicated state machines, with each block applying transactions that move the global state forward. Unlike a Turing machine, a finite state machine does not assume infinite tape or unbounded memory.", letter: "S" },
  { term: "Tangle", definition: "A tangle is a DAG-based consensus structure where each new transaction references and validates one or more previous transactions. Security and confirmation arise from cumulative references rather than linear block chains. Unlike traditional blockchains, tangles avoid fixed-size blocks and can allow more fluid parallel issuance.", letter: "T" },
  { term: "Testnet", definition: "A testnet is a blockchain network that mirrors a mainnet\u2019s protocol but uses valueless tokens and relaxed constraints for development and experimentation. Developers use it to test applications and upgrades without risking real funds. Unlike mainnet, testnet failures and exploits do not carry direct economic consequences.", letter: "T" },
  { term: "Token", definition: "A token is a digital asset unit recorded on a ledger, often implemented as a smart contract rather than a base-layer currency. It can represent utility, rights, access, or claims in a specific application or ecosystem. Unlike a native coin, which is intrinsic to consensus, many tokens are layered on top of an existing chain like Ethereum.", letter: "T" },
  { term: "Token, Non-Fungible (NFT)", definition: "An NFT is a token designed so that each unit is uniquely identifiable and not interchangeable on a one-to-one basis with others of the same type. It is commonly used to represent distinct digital or physical items such as art, tickets, or deeds. Unlike fungible tokens, where units are identical, NFTs encode per-token metadata or identifiers.", letter: "T" },
  { term: "TOKEN, SECURITY", definition: "A security token is a token that represents regulated investment interests, such as equity, debt, or revenue share, in compliance with securities law. It encodes ownership rights and often transfer restrictions directly into its logic or registry. Unlike utility tokens, which focus on access or usage within a product, security tokens are explicitly tied to financial ownership and returns.", letter: "T" },
  { term: "Token, Stablecoin", definition: "A stablecoin token is a cryptocurrency designed to track the value of another asset, usually a fiat currency like the US dollar. It maintains its peg using mechanisms such as collateral reserves, algorithms, or arbitrage incentives. Unlike volatile native coins, stable tokens aim to minimize price fluctuation for transactional or accounting convenience.", letter: "T" },
  { term: "Token, Utility", definition: "A utility token is a token that grants access to a product, service, or function within a specific application ecosystem. It is intended to be consumed or used as \u201cfuel\u201d rather than primarily held as an investment. Unlike security tokens, utility tokens are not meant to confer ownership or profit rights, though in practice the line can blur.", letter: "T" },
  { term: "Tokenization", definition: "Tokenization is the process of mapping rights, assets, or business logic into digital tokens recorded on a ledger. It allows physical goods, financial instruments, or entitlements to be represented, traded, and programmed on-chain. Unlike simple database entries, tokenized representations can inherit blockchain properties like programmable transfers and shared verifiability.", letter: "T" },
  { term: "Total-Complete", definition: "Total-complete refers to programming languages or systems where all functions are guaranteed to terminate and cannot express infinite loops. This constraint allows stronger static analysis and optimization. Unlike Turing-complete languages, total-complete systems trade expressiveness for decidability and safety.", letter: "T" },
  { term: "Transaction", definition: "A transaction is a discrete operation submitted to a blockchain that proposes changes to the ledger state, such as transferring funds or invoking a contract. It carries inputs, outputs, and metadata needed for validation and execution. Unlike blocks, which bundle many operations, a transaction is the atomic unit of state change from a user\u2019s perspective.", letter: "T" },
  { term: "Transaction Fee", definition: "A transaction fee is the amount of native token attached to a transaction as compensation to miners or validators for including and processing it. It signals priority when block space is limited and funds network operation. Unlike the transaction amount, which moves value between users, the fee is consumed by the protocol\u2019s security providers.", letter: "T" },
  { term: "TRANSACTION POOL", definition: "The transaction pool (mempool) is the set of valid but unconfirmed transactions known to a node awaiting inclusion in a block. Nodes share and manage these pools according to local policies like fee thresholds and size limits. Unlike the blockchain itself, the pool\u2019s contents are ephemeral and may differ across nodes.", letter: "T" },
  { term: "Trustless", definition: "Trustless describes systems where participants do not need to rely on each other\u2019s honesty or on a central authority, because protocol rules and cryptography enforce correct behavior. Verification replaces trust, as nodes can independently check proofs or signatures. Unlike traditional arrangements that hinge on reputation or contracts alone, trustless designs minimize the damage a bad actor can inflict without broad collusion.", letter: "T" },
  { term: "Turing-Complete", definition: "Turing-complete refers to a programming system capable of simulating any Turing machine, given enough time and memory. It means the language can express arbitrary algorithms, including loops and conditional branching without predefined limits. Unlike total-complete systems, Turing-complete ones can encode non-terminating or undecidable behaviors.", letter: "T" },
  { term: "Turing-Machine", definition: "A Turing machine is an abstract computation model consisting of a finite control (states), an infinite tape of cells, and a read/write head that moves along the tape according to transition rules. It formalizes what it means for a function to be computable. Unlike a finite state machine, a Turing machine assumes unbounded memory via its tape.", letter: "T" },
  { term: "Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)", definition: "A UTXO is a discrete, spendable output from a prior transaction that has not yet been referenced as an input in any later transaction. It represents a specific quantity of coin that can be spent only by satisfying its locking conditions. Unlike account balances, which aggregate value, UTXOs treat funds as individual \u201ccoins\u201d that are fully consumed and re-created in each spend.", letter: "U" },
  { term: "Virtual Machine (VM)", definition: "A VM is an abstract computing environment that emulates a complete machine or runtime on top of underlying hardware or another OS. It isolates programs and provides a standardized instruction set. Unlike native execution, VM execution adds a translation layer but improves portability and security.", letter: "V" },
  { term: "Vyper", definition: "Vyper is a Python-inspired smart contract language for the EVM that emphasizes simplicity, auditability, and formal verifiability. It intentionally omits certain complex features to reduce attack surface. Unlike Solidity, which is feature-rich and flexible, Vyper focuses on safer, more restrictive constructs.", letter: "V" },
  { term: "Wallet", definition: "A wallet is software or hardware that manages private keys and derives addresses for interacting with blockchains. It signs transactions locally so that users can authorize spends without exposing their keys. Unlike an exchange account, a non-custodial wallet gives the user direct control over their cryptographic keys.", letter: "W" },
  { term: "Wallet, Multisignature", definition: "A multisignature wallet is a wallet whose funds are locked under a script requiring multiple independent signatures to authorize a spend. It enforces M-of-N approval policies at the protocol level. Unlike single-key wallets, multisig setups distribute control among several parties or devices to reduce single-point-of-failure risk.", letter: "W" },
  { term: "Web Assembly (WASM)", definition: "WASM is a low-level binary instruction format designed for efficient, sandboxed execution in web browsers and other hosts. It allows languages like C++ or Rust to compile to a compact, portable runtime. Unlike JavaScript, WASM is meant as a compilation target, not primarily a human-authored language.", letter: "W" },
  { term: "Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proof", definition: "A ZK proof is a cryptographic protocol that lets a prover convince a verifier that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond that fact. It is used to demonstrate possession of secrets or correctness of computations while preserving privacy. Unlike standard proofs that expose all intermediate data, ZK proofs intentionally hide the underlying witness.", letter: "Z" },
